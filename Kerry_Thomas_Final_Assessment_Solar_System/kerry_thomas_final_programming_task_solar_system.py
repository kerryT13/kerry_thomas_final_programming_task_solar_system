# Reflection and Development Notes 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When I first started this project, I built the solar system data using nested dictionaries 
# to hold each planetâ€™s details. My main focus at that point was just to get the data structure 
# working properly and make sure I could access things like mass and distance.  

# I didnâ€™t actually get access to my course until the third week, so even though I worked hard 
# to catch up, I was still slightly behind when I began the assessment. At that stage, I hadnâ€™t 
# yet started Week 5 of the Codio lessons, which is where Object Oriented Programming is introduced. 
# Once I reached that section and checked the assessment criteria, I realised that I needed to use 
# classes throughout the program. I then completely reworked my code so that each planet became an 
# object of a Planet class rather than just being part of a dictionary.  

# Originally, I only stored a single number for each planetâ€™s moons, but later I realised it would be 
# better to represent them properly. I created a separate Moon class and linked moon objects to their planets. 
# I also added a moon_count attribute so I could show the total number of moons as I only listed a few main examples
# and the code only counted the examples which was not a true reflection of the number of moons.  

# While improving my code, I ran into a few problems such as missing parameters, typos, and indentation 
# errors that happened when I moved things around. Each time, I used error messages and small tests to 
# figure out what was wrong. One of the biggest lessons was that the parameters in the class definition 
# have to exactly match the arguments when you create each planet a mistake I made a few times early on.  

# Through this project I also learned about handling case insensitive input using casefold(), sorting 
# planets with lambda functions, and checking for keywords in user questions using string search logic. 
# I found useful examples and explanations on Stack Overflow, W3Schools, and the SitePoint article on nested 
# dictionaries, all of which are referenced in the different versions of my code on. 

# My GitHub history shows the different stages of this project as I made improvements and tested each change.

# The brief mentioned that I could use a unit testing framework or Tkinter, but I decided to keep my test plan
# text based and focused on meeting the main functional requirements. As I completed this assessment before 
# finishing the final weekâ€™s lessons which cover testing due to not being able to catch up, I relied on my real
# world experience of writing and executing test plans instead. Adding those extra features would have meant a
# restructure, so I felt it was better to focus on ensuring the program worked correctly and was thoroughly
# tested through my own plan.



# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AI USE STATEMENT
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# I used AI tools (ChatGPT) during the early stages of this project to help me understand Python concepts,
# object-oriented design, and potential ways to structure the program. I used these tools to clarify ideas
# and check my understanding of syntax, but all program design decisions, coding, and debugging were
# completed independently.
